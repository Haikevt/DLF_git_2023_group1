In case you are "Ava".

Ask a question to "Haike:"
- Look for a question in "My_questions.txt", take the code (For example 369229efa72293bbb272)
- Go to the branch of Haike:
  "git checkout Haike"
- Modify the "Q_en_A.txt file using your favorite editor, only add the question and the code.
- Make a commit
  "git add Q_en_A.txt"
  Option 1: "git commit"
  (editor appears. Type a useful commit message. Using vim? With 'i' you can edit, with 'esc esc esc' (sometimes needed) and than ':wq' (w = write, q = quit) and then 'enter' you leave the editor)
  Option 2: "git commit -m 'insert a useful message'"
- Push your new commit
  "git push"
- Entertain yourself while you wait for Haike to answer your question (You could, just a suggestion, answer questions you yourself have received)
- Is the answer useful? Go to main and add the useful information in the notebook using the names and the question and answer.
  "git checkout main"
  add the information in "Notebook.txt" using your favorite editor.
  "git add notitieboekje.txt"
  "git commit"
  "git push"
- Continue until you have solved the mystery!


Answering a question:
- Look if you received a question:
  Are you on your own branch? ("git status") No -> "git checkout <Your branch>" (So "git checkout Ava" if you are Ava).
  Check your branch with "git branch" 
- Pull adjustments to that branch
  "git pull"
- Read the "Q_en_A.txt"
- Is there a code without an answer?
  Add the answer with your favorite exitor
  Make a commit
    "git add Q_en_A.txt"
    "git commit"
    Make a commit message
  Push your commit
    "git push"
